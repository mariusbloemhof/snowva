# Feature Specification: Centralized Design Token System

**Feature Branch**: `001-styling`  
**Created**: September 26, 2025  
**Status**: Draft  
**Input**: User description: "Create a centralized design token system following industry standards (Design Tokens Community Group specification). We need a comprehensive centralized CSS styling solution for the Snowva Business Hub that addresses constitutional requirements for design system consistency, supports theming capabilities, and follows industry best practices. The solution must transform the current scattered Tailwind utility approach into a maintainable, semantic design system."

## Execution Flow (main)
```
1. Parse user description from Input
   ‚Üí Extracted: centralized design tokens, constitutional compliance, theming, industry standards
2. Extract key concepts from description
   ‚Üí Actors: developers, designers, end users
   ‚Üí Actions: create tokens, apply themes, maintain consistency
   ‚Üí Data: design tokens, component styles, theme configurations
   ‚Üí Constraints: constitutional requirements, industry standards compliance
3. For each unclear aspect:
   ‚Üí All aspects clearly defined in comprehensive architecture document
4. Fill User Scenarios & Testing section
   ‚Üí User flow: developer applies consistent styling, user switches themes
5. Generate Functional Requirements
   ‚Üí Each requirement testable against design system implementation
6. Identify Key Entities (design tokens, themes, components)
7. Run Review Checklist
   ‚Üí All requirements clearly specified
   ‚Üí No implementation details exposed to business stakeholders
8. Return: SUCCESS (spec ready for planning)
```

## ‚ö° Quick Guidelines
- ‚úÖ Focus on WHAT users need and WHY
- ‚ùå Avoid HOW to implement (no tech stack, APIs, code structure)
- üë• Written for business stakeholders, not developers

## User Scenarios & Testing

### Primary User Story
As a development team working on the Snowva Business Hub, we need a centralized design system that ensures visual consistency across all interface components, supports multiple themes including accessibility options, and enables efficient maintenance of styling standards. This system must comply with constitutional requirements for centralized design systems and follow industry best practices for design token management.

### Acceptance Scenarios
1. **Given** a developer is creating a new component, **When** they apply design system classes, **Then** the component automatically inherits consistent colors, spacing, and typography that match the established brand guidelines
2. **Given** an end user prefers dark mode, **When** they switch to dark theme, **Then** all interface elements display with appropriate dark theme colors and remain fully functional
3. **Given** a designer updates brand colors, **When** the design tokens are updated, **Then** all components across the application reflect the new colors without requiring individual component changes
4. **Given** a developer is styling status indicators, **When** they use semantic status classes, **Then** the indicators display consistent styling and behavior across all application screens
5. **Given** the application is being maintained, **When** new components are added, **Then** they automatically integrate with the existing design system without creating styling inconsistencies

### Edge Cases
- What happens when a component requires styling that doesn't exist in the design system?
- How does the system handle theme switching while preserving user interactions and state?
- What occurs when theme switching is interrupted by navigation or component updates?
- How does the system maintain performance when loading multiple theme variants?

## Requirements

### Functional Requirements
- **FR-001**: System MUST provide a centralized design token system that defines all colors, spacing, typography, and visual properties used across the application
- **FR-002**: System MUST support multiple themes including light mode and dark mode
- **FR-003**: System MUST enable theme switching that preserves user preferences in browser localStorage across sessions and completes within 500ms maximum
- **FR-004**: System MUST provide semantic CSS classes for all common UI patterns (buttons, forms, tables, status indicators)
- **FR-005**: System MUST ensure consistent color usage across all interface elements
- **FR-006**: System MUST maintain visual consistency across all components when themes are applied
- **FR-007**: System MUST support the existing Snowva brand colors while enabling future brand evolution
- **FR-008**: System MUST provide status indicator styling that works consistently across invoices, quotes, customers, and other business entities
- **FR-009**: System MUST enable developers to create new components that automatically inherit design system properties
- **FR-010**: System MUST support print-friendly styling that maintains brand identity in PDF documents
- **FR-011**: System MUST provide smooth visual transitions for theme switching and interactive elements
- **FR-012**: System MUST provide design tokens that strictly conform to the Design Tokens Community Group specification format and reject non-compliant tokens
- **FR-013**: System MUST ensure styling changes can be made centrally without requiring updates to individual components
- **FR-016**: System MUST replace all existing Tailwind utility classes with semantic design system classes in a single coordinated update
- **FR-014**: System MUST support responsive design patterns that work across desktop, tablet, and mobile devices
- **FR-015**: System MUST provide clear visual hierarchy through consistent typography and spacing scales

### Key Entities
- **Design Token**: Represents a single design decision (color value, spacing unit, font size) with semantic naming and theme-specific values
- **Theme Configuration**: Defines a complete set of design token values for a specific visual mode (light, dark)
- **Semantic Component Class**: Represents styling for a specific UI pattern (button, form input, status badge) that uses design tokens
- **Status Indicator**: Represents visual styling for business entity states (paid, overdue, draft) with consistent color coding
- **Brand Asset**: Represents Snowva-specific design elements including logo treatments and brand-specific color applications

## Clarifications

### Session 2025-09-26
- Q: Performance requirements for theme switching: What is the maximum acceptable delay for theme switching to complete across the application? ‚Üí A: Maximum 500ms - Must not exceed this threshold under any conditions
- Q: Design token validation scope: How strictly should the system validate design token format compliance? ‚Üí A: Strict - Reject any tokens that don't perfectly match specification
- Q: Component migration strategy: What should happen to existing components during the transition? ‚Üí A: Big Bang - Replace all Tailwind utilities simultaneously in one update
- Q: Theme persistence mechanism: Where should theme preferences be stored? ‚Üí A: localStorage - Browser local storage only
- Q: Accessibility requirements: Is WCAG compliance and accessibility support required for this project? ‚Üí A: No - Accessibility features not required
