# Feature Specification: Centralized Theming System

**Feature Branch**: `001-theming`  
**Created**: 2025-09-26  
**Status**: Draft  
**Input**: User description: "We need to create a standarized style sheet and CSS classes for all elements: Create centralized CSS classes for common patterns (.table-row, .form-input, .button-primary) Refactor existing components to use semantic classes instead of utility classes Establish component library with consistent styling patterns. We also need to implement a theming system that ties in with the centralized styling patters, so that the look at feel and style of the entire app can be changed by selecting a theme. We need to then create several standard and awesome themes that can be selected by the user, including light, dark, vibrant and many more"

## ‚ö° Quick Guidelines
- ‚úÖ Focus on WHAT users need and WHY
- ‚ùå Avoid HOW to implement (no tech stack, APIs, code structure)
- üë• Written for business stakeholders, not developers

## Clarifications

### Session 2025-09-26
- Q: Theme storage and synchronization: How should user theme preferences be stored and synchronized? ‚Üí A: Firebase Firestore with offline fallback to local storage
- Q: Theme transition performance: What are the acceptable performance targets for theme switching? ‚Üí A: Fast (<300ms) - Brief transition with loading indicator
- Q: Accessibility compliance level: What accessibility standards must all themes meet? ‚Üí A: Not important
- Q: Theme customization scope: How extensive should the theming system be? ‚Üí A: Full visual control - Colors, fonts, spacing, borders, shadows
- Q: Migration strategy for existing components: How should the transition from utility classes to semantic classes be handled? ‚Üí A: Big bang - Convert all components simultaneously in one release

## User Scenarios & Testing

### Primary User Story
As a Snowva Business Hub user, I want to customize the visual appearance of the application to match my preferences and working environment, so that I can have a comfortable and personalized experience while managing sales operations.

### Acceptance Scenarios
1. **Given** a user is logged into the system, **When** they access theme settings, **Then** they can see available theme options (Light, Dark, Vibrant, etc.)
2. **Given** a user selects a different theme, **When** the theme is applied, **Then** all interface elements (tables, forms, buttons, navigation) immediately reflect the new styling
3. **Given** a user has selected a custom theme, **When** they return to the application later, **Then** their theme preference is remembered and automatically applied
4. **Given** the system uses centralized styling, **When** developers need to update component appearance, **Then** changes propagate consistently across all similar components throughout the application

### Edge Cases
- What happens when a selected theme is no longer available in a system update?
- How does the system handle theme switching while forms have unsaved changes?
- What occurs if theme data becomes corrupted or unavailable?
- How does the system handle Firebase connectivity issues during theme preference synchronization?
- What happens if the big bang migration introduces visual inconsistencies across components?

## Requirements

### Functional Requirements
- **FR-001**: System MUST provide a centralized stylesheet with semantic CSS classes for all common UI patterns
- **FR-002**: System MUST offer multiple pre-defined themes including Light, Dark, and Vibrant variants
- **FR-003**: Users MUST be able to select and switch between available themes through a settings interface
- **FR-004**: System MUST apply theme changes across all application components within 300ms with brief loading indicator, without requiring page refresh
- **FR-005**: System MUST persist user theme preferences in Firebase Firestore with offline fallback to local storage and restore them on subsequent sessions
- **FR-006**: System MUST ensure all existing components (tables, forms, buttons, modals, navigation) work consistently with all available themes
- **FR-007**: System MUST replace all scattered utility classes with semantic component classes across the entire codebase in a single coordinated release
- **FR-008**: System MUST provide theme preview functionality so users can see appearance changes before confirming selection
- **FR-009**: System SHOULD ensure basic readability across all themes but accessibility compliance is not required
- **FR-010**: System MUST gracefully fallback to default theme if user's selected theme becomes unavailable

### Key Entities
- **Theme**: Represents a comprehensive visual styling configuration including colors, typography (fonts, sizes), spacing, borders, shadows, and all component appearance rules
- **StyleSheet**: Centralized collection of semantic CSS classes that define consistent styling patterns for reusable components
- **Component Classes**: Semantic CSS classes (.table-row, .form-input, .button-primary, etc.) that abstract styling implementation from component usage
- **User Preferences**: Firebase Firestore document containing user's selected theme and related customization settings, with offline synchronization capabilities
- **Theme Settings**: Interface element that allows users to browse, preview, and select available themes
